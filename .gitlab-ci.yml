# defaults for "only"
# We need to run the CI jobs in a "merge request specific context", if CI is
# running in a merge request. Otherwise the environment variable that holds the
# merge request ID is not available. This means, we must set the "only"
# variable accordingly - and if we only do it for one job, all other jobs will
# not get executed. So have the defaults here, and use them in all jobs that
# should run on both the master branch, and in merge requests.
